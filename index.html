            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>I'm an Egyptian American Artist, Writer, and Software Developer who lives in Redmond, Washington. With a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Masters in Business Administration (MBA). I spent over 10 years in the tech industry before I decided to pursue my passion for the arts and creativity full time. I wrote a fantasy novel that is in the process of being published, created an injection tracking app to help individuals with diabetes, MS, RA... etc, and started my art business, selling my original paintings and prints. Now, I'm re-learning software development in the Code Fellows 201 class.</p>
